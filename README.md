# Hi, I'm Mehrad 👋

Backend Developer | ASP.NET Core | Building real-world APIs

I focus on building **clean, maintainable, and production-ready backend systems** using modern architectural patterns.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- Design backend services using **DDD** and **Clean Architecture**
- Build APIs with **Minimal APIs** and **CQRS**
- Model data efficiently with **Entity Framework Core**
- Implement authentication, authorization, and role-based access
- Work with relational databases and caching systems
- Care deeply about **code clarity**, **separation of concerns**, and **real-world scalability**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Backend**
- .NET  8 / 9
- C#
- ASP.NET Core (Minimal APIs)
- Entity Framework Core
- MediatR (CQRS)
- FluentValidation

**Architecture & Patterns**
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Clean Architecture
- CQRS
- Repository & Unit of Work
- Background jobs

**Data & Infrastructure**
- SQL Server / PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker (basic usage)
- Logging & diagnostics

**Other**
- Swagger / OpenAPI
- Postman
- Git & GitHub

## 📌 Featured Projects
Here are some projects that reflect how I think and work as a backend engineer:

- **File Manager API**  
  File upload and management service using DDD + CQRS + Minimal APIs

- **Authentication Service**  
  JWT authentication, refresh tokens, role & permission management

- **Reporting Service**  
  File processing and report generation with a clean service-oriented design

👉 Check the pinned repositories below for details.

## 🚀 How I Approach Development
- I prioritize **long-term maintainability** over short-term hacks
- I avoid leaking infrastructure concerns into domain logic
- I write code that other developers can **read, test, and extend**
- I treat side projects as **real systems**, not tutorials
